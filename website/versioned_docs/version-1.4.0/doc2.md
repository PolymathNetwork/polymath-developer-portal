## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We ask that you follow the following responsible disclosure guidelines:

1. Do not exploit a security vulnerability you discover for any reason.

2. Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations.

3. Give us a disclosure deadline on any vulnerability you report, consistent with complexity of the fix. Please give us a reasonable amount of time (minimum 2 weeks) to correct the issue before making the exploit public.

4. Give us 3 business days to respond to your report. We will provide our assessment of the severity of the vulnerability and our timeline for patching it based on our internal assessment of when we can have a fix in place.
