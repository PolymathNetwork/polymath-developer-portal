## Tutorial Topics:

## 1. Creating Modules for the Polymath ST-20 Ecosystem

## Modular Security Tokens

Security Tokens on the Polymath platform are built with modularity, extensibility and flexibility in mind.

The Polymath implementation of the ST-20 standard allows developers to build new types of security token functionality as modules, which can be dynamically attached to a security token by the issuer of that token.

Modules can represent any type of security token functionality, but there are a few key types of modules with special access or permissions to the security token.

## Module Types

Currently we have three special module types defined, which are listed below, and we are now working on adding an additional Staking module.

Modules don’t have to fall into one of these categories, but if the functionality they represent corresponds to one of these categories, they should implement the additional interface associated with that category.

## TransferManager

TransferManager modules are used in determining whether a token transfer is valid between two parties. They are used by the security token’s verifyTransfer function, which in turn is used by the transfer and transferFrom functions of the token.

The corresponding interface to implement is:

[ITransferManager.sol](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-core/blob/master/contracts/modules/TransferManager/ITransferManager.sol

## PermissionManager

PermissionManager modules are used to manage permissions across modules, and the security token. They provide a flexible way for the issuer to delegate certain types of token permissions to individuals, or modules.

The corresponding interface to implement is:

[IPermissionManager.sol](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-core/blob/master/contracts/modules/PermissionManager/IPermissionManager.sol)

## STO

STO (Security Token Offering) modules are used to raise funds, or more generally mint and burn security tokens. They are used by the mint and burn functions of the underlying token.

The corresponding interface to implement is:

[ISTO.sol](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-core/blob/master/contracts/modules/STO/ISTO.sol)

## Developing New Modules

In this article, we are going to use the following example — we want to create an STO module (since it will be minting tokens) that allows issuers to easily initialise pre-sale token allocations. Tokens for pre-sale participants can only be created until a fixed date (typically the start of the public STO).

The below code snippets are sometimes shortened to make their core functionality clearer. All of these contracts appear in a complete form in our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/polymathnetwork), including test cases for this module.

## Business Logic

We’ll start by looking at the module contract which will contain our business logic (the logic to allow the issuer to record pre-sale token allocations).

The basic logic, to allow the issuer to create pre-sale token allocations, would look something like:

``` 
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract PreSaleSTO {
  using SafeMath for uint256;
  event TokensAllocated(address _investor, uint256 _amount);
  function allocateTokens(address _investor, uint256 _amount) public
  {
    require(_amount > 0);
    IST20(securityToken).mint(_investor, _amount);
    investors[_investor] = investors[_investor].add(_amount);
    emit TokensAllocated(_investor, _amount);
  }
}

```

## Interfaces and Initialisation

To turn this into a module which can live in the Polymath Ecosystem, we need to add some boiler plate code and inherit from the module interface.

Since this module needs to mint tokens, it is of the special module type STO. As such it must inherit from the ISTO interface, which in turn inherits from IModule.

The IModule interface defines some functionality which is common across all modules, specifically:

```
//Simple interface that any module contracts should implement

contract IModule {
  address public factory;
  address public securityToken;
  ERC20 public polyToken;
  constructor (address _securityToken, address _polyAddress) public
  {
    securityToken = _securityToken;
    factory = msg.sender;
    polyToken = ERC20(_polyAddress);
  }
  function getInitFunction() public returns (bytes4);
  function getPermissions() public view returns(bytes32[]);
}

```

The ISTO module inherits from IModule, and defines some additional functions used just by modules of type STO:
```
contract ISTO is IModule {

  function getRaisedEther() public view returns (uint256);
  function getRaisedPOLY() public view returns (uint256);
  function getNumberInvestors() public view returns (uint256);
}

```

Even though a pre-sale allocation does not involve any transfer of funds, for the sake of transparency we will record the amount of ETH or POLY involved in the pre-sale token allocation.

So, let’s add these to our PreSale module contract!

```
contract PreSaleSTO is ISTO {

  using SafeMath for uint256;
  event TokensAllocated(address _investor, uint256 _amount);
  mapping (address => uint256) public investors;
  uint256 public investorCount;
  uint256 public endTime;
  uint256 public etherRaised;
  uint256 public polyRaised;
  constructor (address _securityToken, address _polyAddress) public
  IModule(_securityToken, _polyAddress)
  {
  }
  function configure(uint256 _endTime) public onlyFactory {
    require(_endTime != 0);
    endTime = _endTime;
  }
  function getInitFunction() public returns (bytes4) {
    return bytes4(keccak256("configure(uint256)"));
  }
  function getRaisedEther() public view returns (uint256) {
    return etherRaised;
  }
  function getRaisedPOLY() public view returns (uint256) {
    return polyRaised;
  }
  function getNumberInvestors() public view returns (uint256) {
    return investorCount;
  }
  function getPermissions() public view returns(bytes32[]) {
    bytes32[] memory allPermissions = new bytes32[](0);
    return allPermissions;
  }
  function allocateTokens(address _investor, uint256 _amount, uint256 _etherContributed, uint256 _polyContributed) public onlyOwner
  {
    require(now <= endTime);
    require(_amount > 0);
    IST20(securityToken).mint(_investor, _amount);
    investors[_investor] = investors[_investor].add(_amount);
    investorCount = investorCount.add(1);
    etherRaised = etherRaised.add(_etherContributed);
    polyRaised = polyRaised.add(_polyContributed);
    emit TokensAllocated(_investor, _amount);
  }
}
```

## Module Initialisation

As we’ll see in the next section, all modules are created via factory contracts. A factory contract is responsible for creating and configuring all of its modules.

In order for the factory to configure its module, the IModule interface defines `getInitFunction` which returns the signature of the function used to set all of the initial state of the module — in this case just the time until pre-sale allocations can be created (i.e. the start of the STO).

## Module Factories
Every module factory needs to implement the IModuleFactory interface. This defines a few key functions that control the cost of the module (the amount of POLY the issuer needs to pay in order to use the module) as well as providing human readable instructions and descriptions for the module.

The IModuleFactory interface looks like:

```
contract IModuleFactory is Ownable {

  ERC20 public polyToken;
  function deploy(bytes _data) external returns(address);
  function getType() public view returns(uint8);
  function getName() public view returns(bytes32);
  //Return the cost (in POLY) to use this factory
  function getCost() public view returns(uint256);
  function getDescription() public view returns(string);
  function getTitle() public view returns(string);
  function getInstructions() public view returns (string);
}

```

So — let’s create our PreSaleSTOFactory contract, implementing these functions:

```

contract PreSaleSTOFactory is IModuleFactory {

  constructor (address _polyAddress) public
    IModuleFactory(_polyAddress)
  {
  }
  function deploy(bytes _data) external returns(address) {
    if (getCost() > 0) {
      require(polyToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, getCost()));
    }
    //Check valid bytes - can only call module init function
    PreSaleSTO preSaleSTO = new PreSaleSTO(msg.sender, address(polyToken));
    //Checks that _data is valid (not calling anything it shouldn't)
    require(getSig(_data) == preSaleSTO.getInitFunction());
    //Initialise the module
    require(address(preSaleSTO).call(_data));
    return address(preSaleSTO);
  }
  function getCost() public view returns(uint256) {
    return 100;
  }
  function getType() public view returns(uint8) {
    return 3;
  }
  function getName() public view returns(bytes32) {
    return "PreSaleSTO";
  }
  function getDescription() public view returns(string) {
    return "Use this module to initialise pre-sale token allocations";
  }
  function getTitle() public view returns(string) {
    return "Pre-Sale STO";
  }
  function getInstructions() public view returns(string) {
    return "Pre-Sale STO - use allocateTokens to create pre-sale token allocations";
  }
}

```

## Registering Modules

Once you’ve created your new module, all that remains is to add it to the Polymath Ecosystem.

To do this, you need to deploy your factory contract (PreSaleSTOFactory) and then call:

```
function registerModule(address _moduleFactory)

```

The initialisation function can be arbitrarily complex, but here we have a simple `configure` function that just sets this `endTime` value.
