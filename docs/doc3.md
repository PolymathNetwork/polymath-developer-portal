They allow the issuer to define checkpoints at which token balances and the total supply of a token can be consistently queried. This functionality is particularly useful for dividend payment mechanisms and on-chain governance, both of which need to be able to determine token balances consistently as of a specified point in time.                                                                	|

For example, if an issuer wishes to pay dividends in POLY, this module allows that with exactly the same flexibility as the EtherDividendCheckpoint module.                                                                                                                                                                                                   	|

These dividends are then paid out proportionally to token holder balances as of the time that the dividend was created, or at the time of a specified checkpoint that was created previously. Dividends can be pulled by investors or pushed by the issuer to each investor using flexible methods that either use the underlying ST20 token to determine the list of investors, or allow the issuer to specify a fixed list of investors. 	|

There are also flags that allow issuers to modify the rules in specific circumstances, for example when tokens are being transferred as part of an STO investment.                                                                                                             	|

| ManualApprovalTransferManager.sol        	| Transfer Manager module for manually approving or blocking transactions between accounts  	| This module provides a flexible way for an issuer to specify one-off rules to either approve or block transfers of tokens between two addresses.Issuers can approve an amount of tokens that can be sent between two addresses, and specify an expiry for this approval. In a similar fashion the issuer can block any transfers between two specified addresses, again with an expiry on the block.                                                                                                                         	|
